{% from shell_session import shell_session %}

I'll be the first to admit my security has room for improvement. Until last year, I was reusing passwords intermixed with a terribly simple mnemonic. Until a few months ago, my phone and computer were totally unencrypted. I've been fighting the change because it's scary. I'm also very lazy and have been dreading the extra work involved with good security. I've put off updating SSH credentials for about two years now for that exact reason.

I decided to at least pretend like I was doing something about that this morning. It's a gargantuan task: managing many keys with many passphrases on many machines with so much typing involved. Rather than actually sitting down to update things, I poked around man pages and Stack Overflow for a bit, avoiding more than anything else. Somehow I managed to put together a halfway decent solution that, so far, seems to remove almost all the heavy lifting.

## Requirements

* [KeePass 2.X](https://keepass.info/download.html)
* [KeeAgent](https://keepass.info/plugins.html#keeagent)
* [`ssh_config`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config)

If you've never used KeePass or KeeAgent, [start here](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/keepass-ssh/). I've written about the two together before.
