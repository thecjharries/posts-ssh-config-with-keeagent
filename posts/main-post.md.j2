{% from shell_session import shell_session %}

I'll be the first to admit my security has room for improvement. Until last year, I was reusing passwords intermixed with a terribly simple mnemonic. Until a few months ago, my phone and computer were totally unencrypted. I've been fighting the change because it's scary. I'm also very lazy and have been dreading the extra work involved with good security. I've put off updating SSH credentials for about two years now for that exact reason.

I decided to at least pretend like I was doing something about that this morning. It's a gargantuan task: managing many keys with many passphrases on many machines with so much typing involved. Rather than actually sitting down to update things, I poked around man pages and Stack Overflow for a bit, avoiding more than anything else. Somehow I managed to put together a halfway decent solution that, so far, seems to remove almost all the heavy lifting.

## Requirements

* [KeePass 2.X](https://keepass.info/download.html)
* [KeeAgent](https://keepass.info/plugins.html#keeagent)
* [`ssh_config`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config)

If you've never used KeePass or KeeAgent, [start here](https://blog.wizardsoftheweb.pro/keepass-ssh/). I've written about the two together before.

On the other hand, it should be possible to set up most of this with vanilla `ssh-agent` or something more opinionated like `gnome-keyring-daemon` or `kdewallet5`. Taking KeePass and KeeAgent out of the equation, in my opinion, generates way more work, but YMMV.

## Problem

Simply put, managing a ton of keys is a serious pain. If, like me, you've never really delved into the myriad ways to beef up your settings, you'll hit a few snags:

* You have to manually add a ton of keys to `ssh-agent`, which means typing passphrases for days when your power goes out, killing the longest continuous uptime you've had in months
* You have to juggle keys in the agent, as most servers have a fairly low retry count (default is, I believe, six)
* You have to manually enter the passphrases for anything specified in your config that's not active in your agent, which seems like a waste of time if you're just going to have to juggle anyway

## Solution

Those statements, built on experience and [prevailing wisdom](https://serverfault.com/a/820048/446829), touch on some pretty major annoyances. However, they all suffer from a perspective problem. They begin with the assumption that a user has many keys and connects to many machines. That's very true. However, they ignore a very important detail: while there are many possible permutations of key and machine, the number of successful permutations is much smaller and (in theory) proper matchings are already known.

`ssh_config` defines a vehicle to specify proper matchings. Providing an `IdentityFile` (or several) per host establishes a match. `IdentitiesOnly` prevents `ssh` from trying anything not specified in the config or CLI, effectively sidestepping the retry issue. `IdentityAgent` provides an agent failsafe (or multiple agents in tandem). KeePass and KeeAgent glue everything together with remembered credentials, making the config much more powerful.

Assuming `~/.ssh/some_key` is in KeePass and available to KeeAgent, this simple config is enough to get you started:

{{
    highlight_block(
        """\
Host simple_name
    HostName fqdn
    User remote_user
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/some_key
    IdentityAgent SSH_AUTH_SOCK
""",
        explicit_lexer_name = 'TextLexer',
        title = '~/.ssh/config',
    )
}}

## Example

All of this will make much more sense after a good example. I'm going to build everything from scratch and try to illustrate the pain points I believe I've mitigated.

### Generate Keys

### Populate KeePass

### Create Environment

### Easy Failure

### Easier Success

## Full Scripts

### `keygen`

### `Vagrantfile`
